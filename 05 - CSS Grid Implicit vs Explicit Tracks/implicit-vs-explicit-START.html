    Explicit vs Implicit
</p>
<p>
    If you (explicitly)created the rule it is an explicit row, column or track.
</p>
<p>
    If you did NOT explicitly set the rule it is an implied or implicit row, column or track. If there are only two rows but 4 elements, you will notice that the 3 and 4 elements wrap to the new line and are surrounded by the dev tool dots that say
    they are implicit or implied. while the first two we created a rule for them and they are explicitly created so the tops and sides of those two will have a thick black line. They will have thick dotted lines to note that the gap was explicitly
    created as well.
</p>
<p>
    The thick black line notes where the explicit row or column starts and stops.
</p>
<p>
    We can choose the sizes for the columns and rows by explicitly giving them a rule or size. To change the implied/implicit rule, we use 'grid-auto-rows' or 'grid-auto-columns'. This will change the default from the browsers default. Both can take
    more than one parameter, but currently firefox doesn't support this, but should soon. Chrome does.
